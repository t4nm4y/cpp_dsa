    if we dont want to go to some path we will return from there
    so while returning
    before we return, also remove the changes made by that func //this is called backtracking (i.e removing the changes made by the func while returning)  -->

    eg: what would have the maze looked like if i had not gone this path
    (and to do so, we need to undo the changes that we made to travel that path)

    insight to backtracking:
        where a choice which will affect the future answers
