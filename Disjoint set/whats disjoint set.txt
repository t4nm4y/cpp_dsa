it has mainly 2 functions
findPar(x) (it finds the parent of the node x)
Union(a,b) (it puts a, b in same component, ie. now there parent becomes same)
*parent is same for all the elements of a component

*Rank: is the no. of children a parent has;

Union by rank:
In doing union of a,b the one which has more rank becomes the new parent
if ranks are same we can make anyone as parent
and finally the rank of the new parent gets updated

its not stl u need to make the functions yourself
