poly means many and phorm means from
many forms of a single thing

compile time(see eg of sum of 2 complex nos.):
    -func overloading
    -operator overloading

run time:
    -virutal functions

*func overloading: 
a func can behave differently depending on the type of input
eg: funcA(); -->this will run if nothing is passed
funcA(int a); -->this will run is an integer val is passed

*operator overloading:
to overload an operator so that it behaves differently 
or simply customize an operator 
eg: like we do in complex nos. --> we customize the + operator to add int and complex part seperately
