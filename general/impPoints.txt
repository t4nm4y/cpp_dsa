*string 
    string is not a built in data type by default unlike int, char
    its a custom built data type
    its implemented as :
    string s;   is same as   char *s;
    (char *string) //this is what it actually is in the library
    it just stores the address of the first letter of the word or line;


*segmentation fault 
    segmentation fault means that u r trying to look or access to that memory that u shouln't use in the code
        basically (u hve touched the segment of memory that u shouldnt have)
    eg: if string s="hi" and u are trying to print *(s+5);
    this will segmentation fault becoz the actual val of the string is till 0,1,3   3 for storing the /0 
    beyond 3 is that segment of memory that we shouldn't change or see cause its possible that it may in use by any other program
    and changing it might therfore crash the system
        basically (u hve touched the segment of memory that u shouldnt have)
  *buffer overflow      
    in this eg when u exceed the allacated memory its called [buffer overflow]
  *stack overflow
    in case of eg: recursion if it keeps on running it will exceed the memory available and its called [stack overflow]
