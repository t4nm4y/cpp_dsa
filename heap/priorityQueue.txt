//queue means fifo
//but in priority queue the elements are inserted and deleted based on their priority
//elements are inserted in their oreder of priority
//and when we delete the element of hightest priority is deleted first
//priority queue is mostly used in algorithms
//here the val of no. is its priority 
if can be of both types 
    -larger the no. more the priority eg: priority of 8 will be > than that of 6
        in this case we implement it using max heap ( becoz max no. will always be at top)
    -smaller the no. more the priority eg: priority of 6 will be > than that of 8
        similarly its implemented using min heap
