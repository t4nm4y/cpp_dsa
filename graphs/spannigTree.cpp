//spanning tree:
//connected subgraph
//no, of edges should be 1 less than the total no. of vertices
//all vertices should be present

//a complete graph has n^(n-2) spannig trees possible

//total no. of spanning tree= eC(v-1) (permutation combination wala formula)
//where e is total no. of edges, and v is total no. of vertices
