*apply this method whenver u see a pattern like:
[the pattern of taking some elements and removing some others]  -->!!vv imp point!!
    [its also like permutations and combinations]

eg: in subset we do this only eg: {a b c} subsets: 
{a b}: in this we took a,b but removed c
{c}: in this we took c but removed a,b etc.


*whats subset method:
-for every element we have 2 choices: either take it or remove it
