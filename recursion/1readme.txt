how to strike that we have to use recursion:
if theres something like: 
-there are many ways to solve a problem
-q can be to count all the ways
-find the min or max way

how to solve such problems:
-always frist try to see the problem in terms of index
-so all possible stuff that u can do with an index;
if sum is asked- count all the stuffs 
if min - find the min(of all stuff)

then finally u can see how u can space optimise it: by using dp: memoisation, tabulation, space optimisation etc.
